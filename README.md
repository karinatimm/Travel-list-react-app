This web application is designed to help travelers create packing lists for their trips, ensuring they don't forget any essential items. Whether you're planning a weekend getaway or a long vacation, Travel List App has you covered.

This project was created to simplify the process of packing for travel. It provides users with a straightforward interface to add items to their packing list and check them off as they pack. Say goodbye to the stress of forgetting important items â€“ Travel List App makes packing a breeze ;)

This project was completed by me as part of the course "The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More" created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman) on the Udemy educational platform.

Happy travels!
